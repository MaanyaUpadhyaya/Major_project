# PreScienceMED : A Medical Chatbot

## Abstract
The project is motivated by the urgent need within the healthcare domain to effectively harness the vast amount of unstructured digital health data. In response to this challenge, the project focuses on the application of automatic text classification techniques, leveraging advancements in natural language processing (NLP) to facilitate precise disease prediction.Central to the project is the utilization of machine learning algorithms and domain-specific knowledge bases to categorize and organize medical text data. Through a systematic approach encompassing data collection, preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation, the project aims to develop robust text classification models tailored to the nuances of medical language and context.The significance of this research lies in its potential to enhance healthcare decision-making and improve patient outcomes. By accurately categorizing medical text data, healthcare professionals can gain valuable insights into disease trends, treatment efficacy, and patient prognosis. This, in turn, can inform clinical decision-making processes, enabling more personalized and effective patient care. By providing healthcare professionals with valuable tools for data-driven decision support, the project seeks to empower them to navigate the complexities of modern healthcare delivery and ultimately improve patient outcomes.
